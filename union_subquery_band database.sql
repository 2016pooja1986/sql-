/*
In MySQL, the UNION operator is used to combine the result sets of two or more SELECT statements into a single result set. 
The UNION operator automatically removes duplicate rows from the final result. 
If you want to include duplicates, you can use UNION ALL.

The basic syntax for using UNION is as follows:
SELECT column1, column2, ...

WHERE condition
UNION
